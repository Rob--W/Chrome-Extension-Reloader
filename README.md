Chrome Extension Reloader
=========================

This extension allows users of Google Chrome to reload an extension with a single click on a button.  
At the options page, a simple yet effective interface provides a quick way to change the "active extension" (the extension which is reloaded upon click of the browser action button).

The button can also be clicked using Ctrl + Shift + E (to change this, go to `chrome://extensions/`, and click on "Keyboard Shortcuts")
